**Objective :**

- To build a full stack JavaScript app that handles file upload to server.

Here are the specific user stories implemented for this project

**User Story 1:**

-  I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

**Note**

This is a test project implemented in Glitch. So max file size is capped to just 50 bytes.
